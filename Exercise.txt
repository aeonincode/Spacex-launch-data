Exercise: Making a POST Request
We've fetched some data from the SpaceX API. Now it's your turn to make some requests!

Using Deno's fetch function, make a POST request to https://reqres.in/api/users with the following body.

{
  name: "Elon Musk",
  job: "billionaire"
}
And print out the body of the server's response.

Hint: Use the asynchronous json() method on the response object.

Bonus: What happens when you pass in "Content-Type": "application/json; charset=UTF-8" as a header in the options object of the request.

Your code in mod.ts:

const response = await fetch("https://reqres.in/api/users", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json; charset=UTF-8"
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    name: "Elon Musk",
    job: "billionaire"
  })
});
 
const body = await response.json();
 
console.log(body);
Which can be run using:

deno run --allow-net mod.ts

The server should respond with:

{
  name: "Elon Musk",
  job: "billionaire",
  id: "<some id>",
  createdAt: "<current timestamp>"
}
The Content-Type header ensures that the server properly reads the body of our request as JSON. Without it, the name and job are not properly parsed.
